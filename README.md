# Numerical simulation for BM and SSR processes

This module allows to simulate general SSR processes as well as a Bouchaud-MÃ©zard precesses.  It is coded in Python.  
It should be called as a normal module, after adding it to the module search path with :

```python
import sys  
sys.path.append('/Users/antoine/Documents/X/3A/stages 3A/CSH Vienne/code')  
import sample  
```
